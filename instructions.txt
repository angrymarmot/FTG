One line of 5 space-delimited integers.

E = number of events to generate
V = number of visitors
R = number of rooms
I = time earliest event can occur
O = time the last event can occur

constraints:

Each visitor can only have one I event in a room at a time.  An O event must take place before another I event another room.
I event must always come first.

Time < 1440 (number of minutes in a day
I time must come before O time.
Output format:

P R I/O T
0 11 I 347


Approach.

Randomly generate E, V I events first.
Randomly generate E, V O events where O > I but less than 1440 for the time value

eventcount, personlimit, roomlimit, ee, le = argv0, argv1, argv2, argv3, argv4
events = [[]]
roomlist = []
personlist = []
For r in xrange (eventcount/2):
    t = rand(ee to 1440)
    r = rand(0 to roomlimit)
    p = rand(0 to personlimit)
    personlist.append(p)
    roomlist.append(r)
    events.append([p, r, I, t])
    t = rand(t to le) (so it's greater than original t)
    events.append([p, r, O, t])
